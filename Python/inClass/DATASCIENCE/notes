    - Statistics
        - 1) Descriptive - mean, median, mod, etc...
            - Normal distributed curve - Bell Curve
                - middle line (average) - mean - add all / total num of item
                                        - median - sort small to big - middle num
                                        - mode - how many times, most num that appear

        - Skew  + - mode, med, mean - good
                - - mean med mode - obtain less than avg (standard deviation, varians - help to define how far from the avg)

        - Standard Deviation, o

        - collect data -->> find avg -->> 


        - bimodel (2 peaks)
        - multimodel(multiple peaks)

        - 2) Inferential -->> study of hypothesis
            - hypothesis testing
            - Null hypothesis - A null hypothesis is a type of statistical hypothesis that proposes that no statistical significance exists in a set of given observations
            - Alternate hypothesis - alternative hypothesis claims that there is an effect
            A null hypothesis claims that there is no effect in the population, while an alternative hypothesis claims that there is an effect.

            - True positive -  ada sickness, test ada sickness
            - True Negative - no sickness, test still no sickness
            - false positive - kata takde sickness, test kata ada 
            - false negative - ada sickness, test kata no sickness -->> need to tune module so last one not produce
