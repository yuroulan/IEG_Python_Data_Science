Exploratory Data Analytics/Analysis (EDA)

Data -> Structure data -> Data preparation -> averaging (statistically)         ->
                                           -> relationship (mathematically)     - exploration data
                       -> Feature Engineering -> creating new columns           ->

Data is - raw (unstructured)
        - structured - has rows and columns (csv, )

if raw, convert into structured data
 - pull out content
    - split, extract and etc
    - good at regular expression

for structured usually got from 
    - DB, RDBMS, NOSQL
    - from machine CSV/Excel (atm, sensors)

* Do data preparation
    - if missing, need to do investigation on why the data missing
    - identifying null values and replace them using avg /relationship
    - dropna
    - isnull
    - fillna
    - interpolate

* Exploration data

* Feature Engineering ('Columns')
    - adding/dropping extra columns
    - date=day, month, year/categorical (male/female)

* graph

Q3 - Q1 = 30 //IQR
encoding, decoding

after do data collection, data preparation/cleaning -> prediction
    - may want to predict something

Train, Testing

train must be higher than testing

train - 70%, test - 30%

train -> ML algorithm (y = mx + c) -> model (y = 3x + 5)
testing  will be compared by the training data (compare predicted with y with test data) - passing x

if 100 % will be overfitting

MYSQL has 2 software:
mysqld - server
mysql - software (command line utility)
