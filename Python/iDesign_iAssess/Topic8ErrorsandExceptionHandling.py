P5 / Custom Exception

Create a class named Student with a single attribute â€“ marks.

Include a method named check_marks in the Student Class.

This method checks whether the marks is greater than  or equal to 90 and if it is greater than or equal to 90, the method returns True.

If the marks is less than 90, a custom Exception named NotEligibleException is raised and an appropriate message as shown in the sample output is displayed.

 

Create a custom Exception class named NotEligibleException.

Invalid age exception
 
A vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice in voting. Government elected by its citizens, and voting is an important right in our society. Log sabha election in Delhi held in October 2016. And as we know that voting age 18, is a minimum age established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to vote.
Thus, write a program to get the name and age of the people who all are eligible for voting.

Note:
If people is eligible to vote only after 18 and above.

This program may generate:
1. InvalidAgeRange Custom Exception when the People's age is below 18
