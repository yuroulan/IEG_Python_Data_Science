Different Sum Operations

Suresh playing a numbers game. The game description is  Suresh picks random numbers and calculate the sum of all numbers, and the problem is some times the sum of the numbers will be float value and he wants to modify that sum by using Floor(), Ceil(), Round() functions and finally, he wants to calculate the difference of these 3 functions.



 

Input Format specifications:

Input consists of a list of values separated by space.
Output Format Specifications:

The first line of output should be the difference between floor()sum - ceil()sum.
Secondly of output should be the difference between the ceil()sum - round()sum.
The third line of output should be the difference between floor()sum - round()sum.
Constraints:

Use only floor() and ceil() round() function Python


Sample Input 1:
23.34 12 25

Sample Output 1:
-1.0
1.0
0.0

Sample Input 2:
-21.23 -18.23 -12

Sample Output 2:
-1.0
0.0
-1.0
